Learning with Errors Key Encapsulation: FrodoKEM-640
Optimized implementation written in portable C
=======================================================================

Simply do:

$ make clean; make

And then execute the following to run the tests:

$ ./frodo/test_KEM

Or execute the following to run the KATs:

$ ./frodo/PQCtestKAT_kem

By default, AES128 is used to generate the matrix "A", OpenSSL's AES implementation
is used for AES, x64 is the targeted architecture, and compilation is performed with GNU GCC.


ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
------------------

make CC=[gcc/clang] ARCH=[x64/x86/ARM] GENERATION_A=[AES128/CSHAKE128] USE_OPENSSL=[TRUE/FALSE]

If OpenSSL is being used and is installed in an alternate location, use the following make options:
    OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/openssl/include
    OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/path/to/openssl/lib

When using GENERATION_A=CSHAKE128, execute the following to run the KATs:

$ ./frodo/PQCtestKAT_kem_cshake
