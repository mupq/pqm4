 * Encoding/decoding functions (codec.c).
 *
 * Encoding functions take as parameters an output buffer (out) with
 * a given maximum length (max_out_len); returned value is the actual
 * number of bytes which have been written. If the output buffer is
 * not large enough, then 0 is returned (some bytes may have been
 * written to the buffer). If 'out' is NULL, then 'max_out_len' is
 * ignored; instead, the function computes and returns the actual
 * required output length (in bytes).
 *
 * Decoding functions take as parameters an input buffer (in) with
 * its maximum length (max_in_len); returned value is the actual number
 * of bytes that have been read from the buffer. If the provided length
 * is too short, then 0 is returned.
 *
 * Values to encode or decode are vectors of integers, with N = 2^logn
 * elements.
 *
 * Three encoding formats are defined:
 *
 *   - modq: sequence of values modulo 12289, each encoded over exactly
 *     14 bits. The encoder and decoder verify that integers are within
 *     the valid range (0..12288). Values are arrays of uint16.
 *
 *   - trim: sequence of signed integers, a specified number of bits
 *     each. The number of bits is provided as parameter and includes
 *     the sign bit. Each integer x must be such that |x| < 2^(bits-1)
 *     (which means that the -2^(bits-1) value is forbidden); encode and
 *     decode functions check that property. Values are arrays of
 *     int16_t or int8_t, corresponding to names 'trim_i16' and
 *     'trim_i8', respectively.
 *
 *   - comp: variable-length encoding for signed integers; each integer
 *     uses a minimum of 9 bits, possibly more. This is normally used
 *     only for signatures.
